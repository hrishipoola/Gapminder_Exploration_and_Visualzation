#Gapminder Exploration & Visualization

The late, magnificent Hans Rosling first entered the zeitgeist with his widely watched TED talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w), which brought to life his organization Gapminder's data. Here, I walk through an exploratory analysis of the Gapminder 2007 global development data, including summary statistics, box and violin plots, histograms, heatmaps, and high level observations and recreate Rosling's colorful multivariate bubble chart using seaborn. In a future post, I'll recreate Rosling's animated time-series bubble plot using plotly.
